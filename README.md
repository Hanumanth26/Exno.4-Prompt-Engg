### .1. Introduction

Manufacturing industries are under constant pressure to minimize downtime, reduce costs, and maximize equipment efficiency. 
Traditional maintenance strategies like reactive and preventive maintenance are insufficient to meet these challenges. Predictive maintenance (PdM) emerges as a strategic solution, leveraging data-driven insights to forecast equipment failures before they occur.
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into PdM significantly enhances its capabilities.
This experiment is designed to explore the development of an AI-powered predictive maintenance system using a range of AI prompting techniques to ensure structured data collection, thorough analysis, and coherent reporting.

### 4. Prompting Techniques Used

1.Zero-shot Prompting

Used to generate initial hypotheses and define maintenance problem statements.

Example Prompt: "What are the common failure modes in CNC machines?"

2. Few-shot Prompting

Provided the model with example failure reports and asked it to generate similar analyses.

Example Prompt: "Given the following sensor data trends and failure reports, analyze the cause."

3.Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Enabled step-by-step reasoning for diagnostic analysis.

Example Prompt: "Step by step, explain how a drop in vibration amplitude could indicate bearing failure."

4. Role-based Prompting

Assigned roles such as 'AI Maintenance Expert' to refine system recommendations.

Example Prompt: "As an AI maintenance expert, analyze the data and recommend a maintenance schedule."

5.Contrastive Prompting

Compared good and bad predictive outcomes to refine model accuracy.

Example Prompt: "Compare two predictive models and identify which one gives fewer false positives."
